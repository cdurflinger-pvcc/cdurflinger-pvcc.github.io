		</tr>
		<tr>
				<td>Integrated development environment (IDE)</td>
				<td>a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development.</td>
		</tr>		
		
<h2>Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)</h2>

		</tr>

<h2>Software Life Cycle: Development phase</h2>

		<tr>
				<td>Requirements analysis</td>
				<td>start of the software life cycle; specify what services the proposed system will provide.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
				<td>Design</td>
				<td>involves creating a plan for the construction of the proposed system.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
				<td>Implementation</td>
				<td>involves the actual writing of programs,creation of data files, and development of databases.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
				<td>Testing</td>
				<td>debugging programs and confirming that the final software product was compatible with the software development process.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
				<td>Modular implementation</td>
				<td> a software design technique that emphasizes separating the functionality of a program into independent, interchangeable modules.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
				<td>Unified Modeling Language (UML)</td>
				<td>a general-purpose, developmental modeling language in the field of software engineering that is intended to provide a standard way to visualize the design of a system.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
				<td>Use case</td>
				<td>a list of actions or event steps typically defining the interactions between a role and a system to achieve a goal.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
				<td>Use case diagram</td>
				<td>depicts the proposed system as a large rectangle in which interaction between the system and its users afe represented as ovals and users of the system are represented as stick figures.</td>
		</tr>

<h2>Data relationships</h2>

		<tr>
				<td>One-to-one</td>
				<td>the association between patients and occupied provate rooms in that each patient is associated with only one room and each room is accosciated with one patient.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
				<td>One-to-many</td>
				<td>the association between physicians and patients in that one physicians is assocoated with many patients and each patient is associated with one physician.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
				<td>Many-to-many</td>
				<td>would occur if we included consulting physicians in the physician-patient relationship.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
				<td>Design pattern</td>
				<td>a predeveloped model for sovling a recurring problem in software design.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
				<td>Software quality assurance (SQA)</td>
				<td>charged with overseeing and enforcing the quality contol systems adopted by the organization.</td>
		</tr>

<h2>Software testing:</h2>

		<tr>
				<td>Glass box testing</td>
				<td>software tester is aware of the interior structure of the software and uses this knowledge when designing the test.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
				<td>Black box testing</td>
				<td>test that do not rely on knowledge ofthe software's interior composition.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
				<td>Beta testing</td>
				<td>a preliminary version of the software is given to a segment of the intended audience with the goal of learning how the software preforms in real-lifesituations before the final version of the product id solidified and released to the market.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
				<td>Alpha testing</td>
				<td>the initial phase of validating whether a new product will perform as expected.</td>
		</tr>

<h2>Documentation</h2>
		<tr>
				<td>User documentation</td>
				<td>explain the features of the software and describe how to use them.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
				<td>System documentation</td>
				<td>describe the software's internal composition so that the software can be maintained later in its life cycle.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
				<td>Technical documentation</td>
				<td>descide how a software systme should be installed and serviced.</td>
		</tr>

<h2>Intellectual property law</h2>
		<tr>
				<td>Software license</td>
				<td>a legal agreement between the owner and user of a software product that grants the user certain permissions to use the product with out transferring ownership rights to the intellectual property.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
				<td>Software disclaimer</td>
				<td> the software developer's formal notice to the user of its software that the developer is denying any and all liability for any damages arising out of using the software as well as denying any implied warranties.</td>
		</tr>
